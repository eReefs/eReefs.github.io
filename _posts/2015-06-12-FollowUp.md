If you'ld like to know more about how to program for science and how you can spend less time wrestling with software and more time doing useful research, then [Software-Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) is for you.

Software-Carpentry ([http://software-carpentry.org](http://software-carpentry.org)) is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching them basic scientific computing skills in a two day workshop.

There is a Software-Carpentry workshop being held in conjunction with the AMOS 2015 conference on July 13-14 in Brisbane [https://damienirving.github.io/2015-07-13-amos/](https://damienirving.github.io/2015-07-13-amos/) that we encourage you to attend.

If there is sufficient interest we could discuss running a dedicated eReefs Software-Carpentry workshop that covers the core material and then delves deeper into the eReefs satellite data and custom data access.
