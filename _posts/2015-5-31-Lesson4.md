What if the dashboard can't do what you want? Well, this little tute will show you a method for access the ereefs data in your own way using freely available tools.

*This is almost entirely a live demo and so these notes are a bit sparse.*

#### Key outcomes:

If you get nothing else out of this brief session i hope you will understand that:

- there are alternative ways to access the eReefs satellite datasets.
- you will have a basic overview of the thredds catalog and folder structure.
- you will be able to use the Panoply software to do advanced data interrogation.

## Exploring Thredds and opendap

Live web based exporation.

[eReefs THREDDS: http://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalog.html](http://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalog.html "The eReefs TDS catalog Homepage")



## Panoply

A good manual can be found here:

[http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/classes/mt452/EdGCM/Documentation/EdGCM_Panoply.pdf](http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/classes/mt452/EdGCM/Documentation/EdGCM_Panoply.pdf)

A copy of this is included in the media folder here:

[EdGCM_Panoply.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/EdGCM_Panoply.pdf)

### Load a dataset

Datasets can be loaded from local sources on your computer, or accessed via the world wide web.

#### Accessing a Local Dataset

* Demo how to download a file from the mwq dashboard and open it in Panoply.

#### Accessing the eReefs THREDDS Data Server

Connect to the thredds data sevrer and show the structure and how similar it looks to the web version.

1. "File"/"Open Remote Catalog"/:

![panoply_2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/panoply_2.png)

2. Paste in the THREDDS Data Server Catalog:

[http://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalog.html](http://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalog.html)

3. You can now navigate through the THREDDS catalog in the "Catalogs" Tab:

![panoply_3.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/panoply_3.png)

 *N.B*: The Folder names refer to periods of time that the data have been aggregated over: P1D = Period one day, P6M = Period 6 months.

4. Once you've found the file you're interested in you can click on the "Open Dataset" button in the toolbar:

![panoply_4.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/panoply_4.png)

5. You can now inspect the file and the datasets it contains using the "Datasets" tab:

![panoply_5.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/panoply_5.png)

##### Plotting that data.

To make a plot of the dataset you just selected (see above) you click on the "Create Plot" button in the toolbar:

![panoply_7.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/panoply_7.png)

### Exercise

The excersise will be the same as Jamie's dashboard example but using the panoply software.

*Panoply Challenge:*

1. Connect to the eReefs THREDDS Data Server Catalog.

2. Plot the last DHD image from the summer.

Extra:

3. Plot last months maximum Chlorophyll values.
