What if you want to do something that neither the dashboard or Panoply can do? This is when you have to break out the programming langauges and create your own software.

We will do some very simple examples of this using Python but if you want to know more then we can probably organise a dedicated workshop for this type of custom data access.

I will be working a lot in an iPython notbook for this Lesson.

The actually iPython notebook can be downloaded here:
