The eReefs Dashboard provides an world wide web interface to the eReefs satellite data files. It is a webpage that enables basic visualisation and acquisition of the core Marine Water Quality and ReefTemp Indices for each day of the year and for composite weeks, months, wet and dry seasons, and calendar years. The Dashboard is built on top of the THREDDS system and uses standard data access protocols through thredds to access the eReefs data files.

The eReefs Marine Water Quality Dashboard can be found at: [http://www.bom.gov.au/marinewaterquality/](http://www.bom.gov.au/marinewaterquality/ "The eReefs Dashboard")

*This is almost entirely a live demo and so these notes are a bit sparse.*
